# VOQR — Voice for AI Chat

**Talk to any AI. Hear every answer. Local. Private. Yours.**

*Click to talk. AI responds by voice. All local.* [Watch with audio →](https://youtu.be/YPq_U5BSbj4)

VOQR adds voice interaction to every AI chat provider in VS Code. Speech-to-text and text-to-speech run entirely on your machine — your voice data never leaves your computer.

## Features

- **Universal** — works with Copilot, HuggingFace, AI Toolkit, and any provider that properly supports the VS Code Language Model API
- **Local & private** — STT (Whisper) and TTS (Kokoro) run on your hardware. No cloud. No telemetry
- **Streaming responses** — hear AI responses sentence-by-sentence as they generate, not after a long wait
- **Push-to-talk or hands-free** — toggle between manual and voice-activated modes
- **Smart text normalization** — AI responses full of markdown, code blocks, and URLs are cleaned up for natural speech
- **Setup wizard** — guided onboarding walks you through installing and configuring your first AI provider
- **Customizable** — adjust speech speed, mute/unmute TTS, choose your AI model

## Quick Start

1. **Install VOQR** from the VS Code Marketplace
2. **Click the mic button** in the status bar (or use your platform's keybinding — see [Keybindings](#keybindings))
3. **Pick an AI provider** — the setup wizard will guide you if you don't have one installed
4. **Talk** — VOQR transcribes your speech, sends it to your AI, and reads the response aloud

That's it. No API keys for VOQR, no accounts, no configuration required.

## Supported Providers

VOQR works with any AI provider that properly implements the [VS Code Language Model API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/language-model):

| Provider | Cost | Setup | Wizard |
|----------|------|-------|--------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Free tier (50 msgs/mo) | Install extension + GitHub sign-in | Guided |
| **HuggingFace** | Free tier available | Install extension + API token | Guided |
| **AI Toolkit** | Free (GitHub Models + local) | Install extension | Guided |
| **Cerebras** | Free tier available | Install extension + API key | Manual — Cerebras extension does not activate reliably |
| **OpenAI Compatible** | Varies | Install extension + endpoint config | Manual — OAICopilot extension has unresolved configuration issues |

The built-in setup wizard walks you through each guided provider step by step. Manual providers work with VOQR but require independent configuration — VOQR will detect them automatically once set up.

## Requirements

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **VS Code** | 1.99.0 or later |
| **OS** | Linux, Windows, macOS |
| **STT** | whisper.cpp (auto-detected, or specify path in settings) |
| **TTS** | Python 3.10–3.13 + Kokoro (auto-installed on first use) |

VOQR auto-detects whisper.cpp and Python on your system. If they're not found, you'll be prompted to configure the paths in settings.

## Keybindings

| Action | Linux | Windows | macOS |
|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| Push to Talk | `Ctrl+Shift+Space` | `Ctrl+F9` | `Cmd+Shift+Space` |
| Toggle Voice Panel | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | `Cmd+Shift+V` |

The **status bar mic button** is always available as an alternative — no keybinding needed.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `voqr.inputMode` | `pushToTalk` | `pushToTalk` or `voiceActivity` (hands-free) |
| `voqr.ttsSpeed` | `1.0` | Speech speed (0.5× – 2.0×) |
| `voqr.ttsAutoPlay` | `true` | Automatically speak AI responses |
| `voqr.sttBackend` | `auto` | `auto` (whisper.cpp), `faster-whisper` (GPU), or `external` |
| `voqr.sttModelSize` | `tiny` | Whisper model: `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `medium` |
| `voqr.debug` | `false` | Verbose logging to output channel |

Quick controls for speed and mute are also available directly in the VOQR panel.

## Privacy

VOQR processes all voice data locally:

- **Speech-to-text:** whisper.cpp runs on your CPU — audio never leaves your machine
- **Text-to-speech:** Kokoro TTS runs on your CPU — no cloud synthesis
- **No telemetry:** VOQR collects zero usage data
- **No account required:** Free tier works without sign-up

For a voice extension, *"we collect no data"* is a feature, not a gap.

## How It Works

```
You speak → Mic capture → Voice activity detection (Silero VAD)
→ Speech-to-text (whisper.cpp) → AI model (your chosen provider)
→ Streaming response → Text normalization → Text-to-speech (Kokoro)
→ You hear the answer — sentence by sentence, as it generates
```

## Comparison

| | VOQR | VS Code Speech | Wispr Flow | Superwhisper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local STT | Yes | Yes | No (cloud) | Yes |
| Local TTS | Yes | Limited | No | No |
| Any AI provider | Yes | Yes | Any text field | Any text field |
| VS Code native | Yes | Yes | No (system-level) | No (system-level) |
| Custom voice | Yes | No | No | No |
| Speaker ID | Coming Soon | No | No | No |
| Offline capable | Yes | Yes | No | Yes (STT only) |
| Price | Free | Free | Free / $15/mo | $8.49/mo |

## What's Next
